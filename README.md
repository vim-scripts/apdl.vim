This is my personal fork of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=540. I decided to have it in my own repository, because the official version was no longer maintained. I took the original one and added some new APDL functions and indentation rules. The functions are updated to the version 15 of Ansys.

## Features:

* Syntax highlighting for ANSYS APDL files. (Nothing fancy, just comment, numbers and function names.)
* Indentation rules (*if, *elseif, *do, etc...)
* Autocompletetion of commands and elements

## To-Do

One of the ideas for future versions is to implement a command that calls the help *.html file of a specific command or element of Ansys.
